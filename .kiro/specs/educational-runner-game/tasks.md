# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Set up enhanced project structure and core interfaces
  - Create modular JavaScript file structure with separate files for each major component
  - Define TypeScript-style JSDoc interfaces for all major data structures (Question, GameState, etc.)
  - Update index.html to load all required JavaScript modules
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 5.2_

- [x] 2. Implement ContentLoader class with JSON integration
  - Create ContentLoader class that can load and parse JSON question files
  - Implement question validation to ensure required fields (prompt, options, answer, feedback) are present
  - Add error handling for malformed JSON and network failures
  - Write unit tests for JSON loading and validation functionality
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_

- [x] 3. Create GameStateManager for state coordination
  - Implement GameStateManager class to track game states ('menu', 'playing', 'question', 'feedback')
  - Add score tracking, lives management, and timing functionality
  - Create state transition methods with proper validation
  - Write unit tests for state management and score calculations
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 2.5, 2.6_

- [x] 4. Build basic runner game mechanics with Kaboom.js
  - Create player character that moves forward automatically using Kaboom.js sprites
  - Implement scrolling background and basic obstacle/gate spawning system
  - Add collision detection between player and game elements
  - Create smooth movement animations and basic physics
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 5. Implement question presentation system
  - Create QuestionPresenter class that displays questions over the game canvas
  - Build UI elements for showing question prompt and multiple choice options
  - Implement answer selection through keyboard input or mouse clicks
  - Add visual feedback for answer selection (highlighting, animations)
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 6. Add feedback and penalty system
  - Implement immediate feedback display for correct and incorrect answers
  - Create "stumble" animation and penalty mechanics for wrong answers
  - Add smooth continuation mechanics for correct answers
  - Display educational feedback text from JSON data
  - _Requirements: 2.4, 2.5, 2.6_

- [x] 7. Integrate question timing and game flow
  - Connect ContentLoader with QuestionPresenter to cycle through questions
  - Implement 5-10 second intervals between questions during gameplay
  - Create seamless transitions between running and question states
  - Add question queue management and cycling logic
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 2.2, 2.3_

- [x] 8. Create comprehensive error handling and validation
  - Add try-catch blocks around all JSON operations and game state changes
  - Implement user-friendly error messages for common failure scenarios
  - Create fallback mechanisms for missing or corrupted question data
  - Add input validation and sanitization for all user interactions
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 3.3_

- [x] 9. Optimize performance and ensure browser compatibility
  - Implement frame rate monitoring and performance optimization
  - Add responsive canvas sizing for different screen sizes
  - Test and optimize memory usage during extended gameplay
  - Ensure compatibility with modern browsers and mobile devices
  - _Requirements: 3.2, 3.3, 6.3_

- [x] 10. Add modular subject support and customization
  - Create configuration system that allows easy swapping of question sets
  - Implement subject-specific styling and theming options
  - Add support for different question types beyond multiple choice
  - Create clear documentation for adding new subjects and question formats
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_

- [x] 11. Implement comprehensive testing suite
  - Write unit tests for all major classes (ContentLoader, GameStateManager, QuestionPresenter)
  - Create integration tests for complete question-answer-feedback cycles
  - Add performance tests with large question sets and extended play sessions
  - Test browser compatibility across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and mobile browsers
  - _Requirements: 3.3, 5.4_

- [x] 12. Create production-ready deployment package
  - Optimize file structure for static hosting deployment
  - Implement proper caching headers and performance optimizations
  - Create example question sets for different subjects (math, vocabulary, science)
  - Add comprehensive README with setup and customization instructions
  - _Requirements: 4.4, 6.1, 6.2, 6.4_
