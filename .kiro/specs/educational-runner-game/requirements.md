# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a lightweight, open-source educational mini-game prototype using Kaboom.js. The game will be a runner-style game that delivers student practice opportunities every 5-10 seconds through JSON-driven content. The core principle is "academic first" - every interaction serves as a learning opportunity, with gameplay supporting educational practice rather than entertainment alone.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an educator, I want to load custom question sets via JSON files, so that I can easily customize the game content for different subjects and learning objectives.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a JSON file is provided THEN the system SHALL parse and load question data dynamically
2. WHEN the JSON contains questions with type, prompt, options, answer, and feedback fields THEN the system SHALL validate and store this data for gameplay
3. IF the JSON file is malformed or missing required fields THEN the system SHALL display an error message and prevent game start
4. WHEN educators want to swap question sets THEN the system SHALL allow loading new JSON files without code modifications

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a student, I want to play a simple runner game with educational challenges, so that I can practice academic concepts in an engaging format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game starts THEN the player character SHALL move forward automatically
2. WHEN 5-10 seconds pass during gameplay THEN a gate or challenge point SHALL appear
3. WHEN a challenge appears THEN the system SHALL display a question from the loaded JSON data
4. WHEN the player selects an answer THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback
5. IF the answer is correct THEN the player SHALL continue smoothly without penalty
6. IF the answer is incorrect THEN the player SHALL experience a small penalty (stumble) and see corrective feedback

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the game to use only Kaboom.js with minimal dependencies, so that it runs efficiently in browsers and remains lightweight.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the game THEN the system SHALL use only Kaboom.js as the primary framework
2. WHEN the game loads THEN it SHALL run efficiently in modern web browsers
3. WHEN measuring performance THEN the game SHALL maintain smooth frame rates on average hardware
4. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL require only static HTML and JavaScript files

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to use only open-source compatible assets, so that the game can be freely distributed and modified.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN selecting assets THEN all graphics, sounds, and code SHALL use MIT, Apache 2.0, CC0, or CC BY licenses
2. WHEN using visual elements THEN the system SHALL primarily use placeholder shapes or small open-source PNGs
3. IF audio is included THEN it SHALL be open-source and focus-friendly
4. WHEN distributing the game THEN all components SHALL allow commercial and non-commercial use, editing, and redistribution

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want the game to be easily customizable for different subjects, so that I can use it across various educational contexts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the code is structured THEN it SHALL be modular and well-commented for easy extension
2. WHEN changing subjects THEN the system SHALL support swapping question types (fractions, grammar, vocabulary, science)
3. WHEN volunteers or interns work on the project THEN the code SHALL be clear enough for them to extend functionality
4. WHEN reskinning for different subjects THEN the visual and audio elements SHALL be easily replaceable

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the game to be hostable as static files, so that deployment is simple and cost-effective.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the game THEN it SHALL work as static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
2. WHEN hosting THEN the system SHALL not require server-side processing or databases
3. WHEN accessing the game THEN it SHALL load quickly over standard internet connections
4. WHEN maintaining the deployment THEN updates SHALL only require replacing static files
