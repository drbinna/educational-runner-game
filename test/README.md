## Test Structure

### Unit Tests
Each major class has comprehensive unit tests covering:
- Constructor initialization
- Public method functionality
- Error handling and edge cases
- Input validation and sanitization
- Performance under normal conditions
- Memory management

### Integration Tests
Tests the interaction between components:
- ContentLoader → GameStateManager → QuestionPresenter flow
- State synchronization across components
- Error propagation and recovery
- Complete user interaction cycles

### Performance Tests
Validates performance requirements:
- Loading 1000+ questions within 1 second
- Processing 1000 question-answer cycles within 5 seconds
- Memory usage staying under reasonable limits
- Consistent performance over time
- Handling concurrent operations efficiently

### Browser Compatibility Tests
Ensures cross-browser functionality:
- Feature detection for missing APIs
- Graceful degradation on limited platforms
- Mobile-specific constraints and adaptations
- Touch event handling
- Viewport and orientation changes

## Test Utilities

The test suite includes comprehensive utilities in `setup.js`:
- Mock question and question set generators
- Performance measurement tools
- Memory usage monitoring
- DOM element mocking
- User interaction simulation
- Browser API mocking

## Coverage Goals

- **Lines**: 80%+
- **Functions**: 75%+
- **Branches**: 70%+
- **Statements**: 80%+

## Performance Benchmarks

### Loading Performance
- 1000 questions: < 1 second
- 5000 questions: < 3 seconds
- Question retrieval: < 1ms average

### Runtime Performance
- 1000 question cycles: < 5 seconds
- State updates: < 0.1ms average
- Memory increase: < 10MB per session

### Browser Compatibility
- All tests pass on Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- Mobile browsers handle reduced feature sets gracefully
- Fallbacks work when APIs are unavailable

## Continuous Integration

The test suite is designed for CI/CD integration:
- Comprehensive exit codes (0 = success, 1 = failure)
- Detailed JSON reports for automated analysis
- HTML reports for human review
- Performance regression detection
- Memory leak detection

## Test Data

Tests use realistic data sets:
- Small sets (3-5 questions) for unit tests
- Medium sets (50-100 questions) for integration tests
- Large sets (1000+ questions) for performance tests
- Malformed data for error handling tests
- Edge cases for robustness testing

## Debugging Tests

### Verbose Output
```bash
JEST_VERBOSE=true npm test
```

### Specific Test Files
```bash
npx jest test/content-loader.test.js --verbose
```

### Debug Mode
```bash
node --inspect-brk node_modules/.bin/jest test/integration.test.js --runInBand
```

## Adding New Tests

### Unit Test Template
```javascript
describe('NewComponent', () => {
    let component;
    
    beforeEach(() => {
        component = new NewComponent();
    });
    
    test('should initialize correctly', () => {
        expect(component).toBeDefined();
        // Add assertions
    });
    
    test('should handle errors gracefully', () => {
        expect(() => {
            component.methodWithError();
        }).not.toThrow();
    });
});
```

### Performance Test Template
```javascript
test('should perform operation within time limit', async () => {
    const startTime = Date.now();
    
    // Perform operation
    await component.performOperation();
    
    const endTime = Date.now();
    expect(endTime - startTime).toBeLessThan(1000);
});
```

## Test Reports

After running tests, reports are generated:
- `test-report.json`: Detailed JSON report
- `coverage/`: HTML coverage reports
- `test-results/`: HTML test reports
- Console output with recommendations

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
1. Update browser compatibility tests for new browser versions
2. Adjust performance benchmarks as requirements change
3. Add tests for new features
4. Review and update test data sets
5. Monitor test execution times and optimize slow tests

### Performance Monitoring
- Track test execution times
- Monitor memory usage during tests
- Watch for performance regressions
- Update benchmarks based on target hardware

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Tests timeout**: Increase timeout in jest.config.js
2. **Memory issues**: Reduce test data size or add cleanup
3. **Browser mocking fails**: Check setup.js for missing APIs
4. **Performance tests fail**: Adjust benchmarks for test environment

### Getting Help
- Check test output for specific error messages
- Review setup.js for available test utilities
- Look at existing tests for patterns and examples
- Use verbose mode for detailed debugging information
