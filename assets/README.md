# Assets Directory

This directory contains game assets including images and sounds.

## Current Assets
- All visual elements are currently generated using Kaboom.js geometric shapes

- Sound files can be added here in the future (must be open-source compatible)

## Asset Guidelines

- Keep file sizes small for web performance
- Use web-compatible formats (PNG, JPG, MP3, OGG)

## Future Additions

- Background images
- Sound effects for correct/incorrect answers
