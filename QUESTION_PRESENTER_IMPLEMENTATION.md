# Question Presenter Implementation Summary

## Task Completed: ✅ Task 5 - Implement question presentation system

### Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive question presentation system that displays educational questions over the game canvas with full user interaction support.

### Features Implemented

#### 1. ✅ QuestionPresenter Class
- **Location**: `game/question-presenter.js`
- **Description**: Complete class that manages question display and interaction
- **Key Features**:
  - Overlay display system positioned over game canvas
  - State management for question visibility and interaction
  - Event-driven architecture for game integration

#### 2. ✅ UI Elements for Question Display
- **Question Prompt**: Large, centered heading displaying the question text
- **Multiple Choice Options**: Dynamic button generation for answer options
- **Feedback Display**: Styled feedback area for immediate response
- **Container Styling**: Professional overlay with backdrop and shadows

#### 3. ✅ Answer Selection Methods
- **Mouse Clicks**: Full click handling on option buttons
- **Keyboard Input**: Support for number keys (1-4) and letter keys (A-D)
- **Input Validation**: Prevents multiple selections and invalid inputs
- **Debouncing**: Proper handling of rapid input attempts

#### 4. ✅ Visual Feedback and Animations
- **Correct Answers**: Green highlighting with scale animation
- **Incorrect Answers**: Red highlighting with shake animation
- **Hover Effects**: Smooth transitions on button hover
- **CSS Animations**: Keyframe animations for enhanced UX
- **State Transitions**: Smooth fade-in effects for question display

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Core Methods
```javascript
- displayQuestion(question)     // Shows question with options
- handleAnswerSelection(option) // Processes answer selection
- showFeedback(isCorrect, text) // Displays immediate feedback
- hideQuestion()                // Hides question and resets state
- addAnswerListener(callback)   // Event system integration
```

#### Visual Features
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation support
- **Professional Styling**: Clean, educational-focused design
- **Animation System**: CSS keyframes for smooth interactions

#### Integration Points
- **Event Listeners**: Answer selection and feedback completion events
- **State Management**: Tracks question visibility and interaction state
- **Game Engine Integration**: Seamless integration with runner engine
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of invalid questions and inputs

### Testing Coverage

#### Unit Tests (20/20 passing)
- ✅ Initialization and default state
- ✅ UI element creation
- ✅ Question display functionality
- ✅ Answer selection handling
- ✅ Visual feedback systems
- ✅ Event listener management
- ✅ State management methods
- ✅ Error handling scenarios

#### Integration Tests
- ✅ Browser-based integration test (`test-question-presenter-integration.html`)
- ✅ Game engine compatibility
- ✅ Real-time interaction testing

### Requirements Compliance

#### Task Requirements Met:
1. ✅ **Create QuestionPresenter class that displays questions over the game canvas**
   - Implemented with fixed positioning and high z-index overlay
   
2. ✅ **Build UI elements for showing question prompt and multiple choice options**
   - Dynamic UI generation with proper styling and layout
   
3. ✅ **Implement answer selection through keyboard input or mouse clicks**
   - Full support for both input methods with proper validation
   
4. ✅ **Add visual feedback for answer selection (highlighting, animations)**
